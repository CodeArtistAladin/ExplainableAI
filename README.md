# ExplainableAI
This project uses a ResNet18 image classifier with LIME to provide explainable AI insights. The Streamlit app lets users upload images, view predictions, and see highlighted regions that influenced the model’s decision. Built with Python, PyTorch, LIME, and Streamlit to make deep learning more transparent.
